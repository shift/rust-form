## Feature Requirements Summary

### Core Enhancements Needed
1. **Relationship Handling** - Foreign keys, joins, cascade operations, many-to-many
2. **Validation Integration** - Custom validation rules, field-level validation, business logic
3. **Advanced Features** - Pagination, filtering, search, sorting, real-time updates

### Specialized Systems
4. **Authentication** - JWT, OAuth2, MFA, sessions, RBAC, audit trails
5. **File Management** - Upload handling, media processing, CDN integration
6. **Real-time** - WebSocket support, live updates, notifications
7. **Workflow Engine** - State machines, approval processes, automation
8. **Multi-tenancy** - Data isolation, tenant-specific configurations

### Data & Analytics
9. **Computed Fields** - Automatic calculations, aggregations, derived values
10. **Versioning** - Content history, revision tracking, diff generation
11. **Reporting** - Analytics dashboards, KPI tracking, scheduled reports
12. **Batch Processing** - Background jobs, bulk operations, queue systems

## Usage

These configurations serve multiple purposes:

1. **Specification Documents** - Define requirements for future development
2. **Test Cases** - Validate new features against real-world scenarios  
3. **Examples** - Demonstrate rust-form capabilities to users
4. **Roadmap Planning** - Prioritize feature development based on common patterns

## Implementation Status

Currently, rust-form supports the basic structure for all these configurations but lacks the advanced features marked in the requirements. The MVP handles:

- ‚úÖ Basic models and fields
- ‚úÖ Simple relationships (foreign keys)
- ‚úÖ Basic CRUD operations
- ‚úÖ SQLx integration
- ‚úÖ Axum web framework

**Next development priorities should focus on the most commonly required features across these examples:**

1. **Enhanced Relationship Handling** (appears in all configs)
2. **Validation Integration** (critical for data integrity)
3. **Advanced CRUD Operations** (pagination, filtering, search)

## Contributing

When adding new future configurations:

1. Document all advanced requirements inline with `# Future:` comments
2. Include realistic field validation rules and constraints
3. Show complex relationships between models
4. Demonstrate advanced features like computed fields, automation, etc.
5. Follow the existing naming conventions and structure patterns

These configurations should represent real-world applications that users would want to build with rust-form.
